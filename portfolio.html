    <!-- IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3>IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System</h3>
        <p>
            This project involves the development of an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System using Arduino technology. The system is designed to detect and measure the level of smoke in the air. A smoke detector sensor is employed to continuously monitor the air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            When elevated levels of smoke are detected, the system triggers an alert mechanism. This includes activating a buzzer to provide a clear audible warning to the surroundings, ensuring that individuals are made aware of the deteriorating air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a practical and valuable application of IoT technology for environmental monitoring and safety. It underscores the potential to use technology for addressing real-world problems, improving safety, and enhancing the quality of life.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>IoT-Powered Sewage Gas Monitoring System</h3>
      <p>Currnetly working in</p><p> 
          The IoT-Powered Sewage Gas Monitoring System is an innovative solution designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of sewage systems. This project focuses on detecting and monitoring the levels of harmful gases in sewage systems, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the system detects elevated gas levels, it triggers multiple alert mechanisms, including sending SMS alerts to designated recipients and activating a buzzer to provide a loud and immediate audible warning. This ensures that potential hazards in the sewage system are promptly addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project showcases the power of IoT in creating a safer environment and preventing environmental hazards. By integrating technology with critical infrastructure, it demonstrates the potential to improve the maintenance and reliability of sewage systems.
